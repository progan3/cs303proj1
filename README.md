# cs303proj1

The code contains the 4 functions stated in the Assignment1 doc that add to the array, modify values in the array, find the index of a value in the array, and replace or remove values in the array. There are also errors thrown by certain functions that can be caught in int main() if the error occurs. The code doesn't need anything special to run and should start once it runs.
